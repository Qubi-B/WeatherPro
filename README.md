# The new PWA weather app
## Introduction
This project's goal is to create a functioning no-ads, no-tracking PWA for weather. This is a new version of [weather-app-one](https://github.com/Qubi-B/weather-app-one), but it has a completely new UI which I made to be responsive, mobile-first.
That's why I have decided to make a cool weather app, working on both desktop and mobile. 
The app is set to be a PWA (Progressive Web App), which will make it possible to be added directly to your homescreen, and function as a native app.

## What will I learn?
Better my web development skills, making responsive apps, using APIs, creating PWAs.

## How to access?
**You can use the app in github pages after the v0.0.2-stable release**

### How to input API key?
> [!TIP]
> In the older version, a file with API key was needed. Now my own API Key is visible and shared to you for app demo purposes. To use your own key, you can input it in app settings (click settings icon on the website), and paste it in the appropirate box.
